# Gradeomizer

A random app for list building.

Builds out lists for up to 4 teaching assistants providing them with students to grade.

This has no outside connection obviously so students are simply a hardcoded array of information.

The small app uses a shuffler algorithm to build out a random list and then pull from it. These lists are directly related to a provided seed, if you want the same list back then simply provide the same seed you used.

## How To

Go to https://dhershman1.github.io/gradeomizer/ and enjoy

## Future

Probably nothing, however some key points might be

- A better way of getting a list of students
- Maybe display previous seeds (they are recorded just not displayed on screen)
- A button to pool all of those users githubs to maybe make grading a bit faster??
- Idk something else I'm sure that could make life easier. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
